You MUST be in the "my-venv" python virtual environment to scrape.
You do so by running the following from '~/coding/algo-search':
	'source my-venv/bin/activate'
From the docs:
	"Virtual environments allow you to not conflict with already-installed Python system packages (which could break some of your system tools and scripts), and still install packages normally with pip (without sudo and the likes)."
